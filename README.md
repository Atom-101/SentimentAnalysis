# SentimentAnalysis
This branch determines the sentiment of tweets using a convolutional neural network.
The network has been trained on the sentiment140 dataset(contains 1.6 million tweets and a corrsponding label for each).
The trained neural network outputs a float value between 0 and 1, for every input sentence or tweet. 1 is highly positive and 0 is highly negative.
